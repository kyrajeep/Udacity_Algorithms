1.Task0
Time Complexity-O(1): constant time because the runtime to access elements in a python array is constant.
2. Task1
Time complexity: O(n) because the for loop goes through the input data linearly.
3. Task2
This program is run in O(n) time because it has two separate for loops that go through the entire list.

4. Task3
PartA
# RUNTIME ANALYSIS: The whole program is run in O(nlog(n)) time because 'sorted()' in Python is used and this function is a type of merge sort.

PartB
# Time complexity: O(n) because the function goes through 'calls' data linearly.


5.Task4
# time complexity: O(n) 
Both 'identify' and 'combine' functions run in O(n), n being the size of the input data.
