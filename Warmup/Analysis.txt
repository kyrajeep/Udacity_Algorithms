1.Task0
Time Complexity-O(1): constant time because the list here works as an array because the data size is fixed. 
2. Task1
Time complexity: O(n) because of the for loops.
3. Task2
This program is run in O(n) time because it has two separate for loops that go through the entire list.
4. Task3
PartA
# RUNTIME ANALYSIS: The whole program is run in O(nlog(n)) time 
PartB
# Time complexity: O(n)
5.Task4
# time complexity: O(n) as there are for loops used but there is no nested for loop.
